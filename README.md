# pctotalsdashboard
Small dashboard for helping friends with making pc part buying decsions
this is going to be very specfic to the friend I am helping each time so if you want to use it you will have to use your own data 
You will need the Dash python package but I am not planning on using pandas at the start but that might change
but this will be several drop downs that will show prices and links and then it give a total price at the bottom, nothing fancy
